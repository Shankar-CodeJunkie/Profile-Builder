### Motivation: 
  I built this application to learn and have a hands-on in developing 
  NextJS applications. I'll document the learnings which I had while developing this application.

`
  ##### NextJS:
  - ServerStaticProps,
  - getInitialProps,
  - Client rendering Vs Server Rendering Vs Server static generation,
  -  Dynamic pages,
  -  Bundling,
   - How to have an express server running on backend

  ##### Redux:
  - createStore wrapper,
  - Store, Reducer, and Action 
  -  Thunk,
  -  Send redux state as props to nextjs application (mapStateToProps)
  
  ##### Styling:
  - Carbon V11.
